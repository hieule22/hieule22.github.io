    <p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Hieu</span> - an aspiring programmer from Truman State
     University.</p>
    <p> From May to August 2016, I interned at Google's Mountain View headquarter as part of the Engineering
      Practicum Program. I was tasked with implementing type schema support for one of Google's largest distributed
      data processing systems.</p>
    <p> From May to August 2015, I interned at FPT Telecom where I was involved in designing a data loss
      prevention tool that identifies sensitive data at rest from bank servers.</p>
    <p> In November 2015, I represented my alma mater in the prestigious International Collegiate Programming
      Contest - a rigorous contest where budding programmers pit their wits against each other to crack
      tough puzzles requiring in-depth knowledge of algorithms and data structures. Our team of 3 attained a
      respectable finish of 11 out of over 300 competiting teams and 2nd place in the state of Missouri.</p>
    <p> My interests include, but are not limited to, programming, mathematics, reading Computer Science
      literature and solving algorithmic questions.</p>
